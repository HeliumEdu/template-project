============

If you find issues, `report them on GitHub <https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok/issues>`_.

If you would like to contribute to the code, the process is pretty simple:

1. Familiarise yourself with this package, `pyngrok's APIs <https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ and other documentation, and `ngrok's documentation <https://ngrok.com/docs>`_.
2. Fork `the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok>`_ and start implementing changes.
3. Write a test that plainly validates the changes made.
4. Build and test locally with ``make local test``
5. Submit a `pull requests <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_ to get the changes merged.

Also be sure to review the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ before
