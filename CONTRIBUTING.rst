Contributing
============

If you find issues, `report them on GitHub <https://github.com/HeliumEdu/template-project/issues>`_.

If you would like to contribute to the code, the process is pretty simple:

1. Familiarise yourself with this project and its dependencies.
2. Fork `the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/HeliumEdu/template-project>`_ and start implementing changes.
3. Write a test that plainly validates the changes made.
4. Build and test locally with ``make local test``
5. Submit a `pull requests <https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_ to get the changes merged.

Also be sure to review the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/HeliumEdu/template-project?tab=coc-ov-file#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct>`_ before
submitting issues or pull requests.
